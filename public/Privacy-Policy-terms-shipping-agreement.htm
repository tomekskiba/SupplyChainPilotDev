MyDialysisSupply.com.  For purposes of the Policy, references to

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The Homecare Services provides a wide
range of information to our patients, including product order management (including
this pilot website MyDialysisSupply.com), product delivery and healthcare
information.  We collect information from you, including personally
identifiable information (your full name, e-mail address and so on) and
nonpersonally identifiable information.  This Privacy Policy
(&quot;Policy&quot;) is designed to tell you about our information collection
practices– that is, the ways we collect information; what kinds of information
we collect; why we collect information; how we use information we collect; with
whom we share information we collect; how you can access, amend, and delete
information we collect from you; and what kinds of security we use to protect
information you provide. Information provided by Homecare Services is not meant
to be a substitute for the advice provided by a physician or other medical
professional. This information should not be used for diagnosing a health
problem or disease; visitors should always consult their own physician.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><u><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Scope of Policy</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Please be aware that this Policy applies
only to Baxter’s Homecare Services program which includes this pilot supply
ordering website (MyDialysisSupply.com). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><u><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>General Information</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The Homecare Services order management
and delivery services (including the pilot online ordering website named MyDialysisSupply.com)
provide home delivery of dialysis supplies.  Personal information will be
provided by you and your dialysis unit staff to facilitate the delivery and
management of your supplies.  This information includes, but not limited to,
your name, address, phone number and prescription information.  By using this
site and providing your personal information, you consent to its use by Baxter
and third party consultants who are performing work on behalf of Baxter for the
purposes described in this Policy. In some cases your information will be used
to identify you as candidates for other patient programs. In these cases you
will be contacted and given the opportunity to opt out of these programs. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The pilot online ordering website named
MyDialysisSupply.com is part of a trial program and will be operational for a
period of 4-6 months.  You will be notified one month in advance of the
discontinuation of services.  When the trial program is over you must return to
your previous method of replenishing your monthly supplies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><u><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Delivery Services</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Baxter’s Homecare Services
Representatives will work with you and your dialysis unit staff to set up your
account and initial order and manage your ongoing home supply requirements. 
Baxter’s Service Specialists will bring your supplies inside your home and
rotate your supplies upon your request.  In some cases, an alternate delivery
company, such as United Parcel Services (UPS) may deliver your product.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>If you or a responsible party are not
home during your scheduled delivery, Baxter’s Service Specialist will contact
your dialysis facility to ask for approval to leave the supplies in a safe
place (covered porch, garage, etc.), deliver to a neighbor who can sign for the
shipment, or bring the supplies back to the warehouse, requiring you to call
Baxter’s Homecare Services to arrange for a redelivery.  The driver will leave
a notice on your door indicating which action was taken.  If redelivery is
required, your dialysis unit may incur additional costs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Supply orders of 5 cases or less will be
delivered by an alternate delivery company such as a commercial carrier or
United Parcel Services (UPS).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Please be aware that the commercial
carriers we use have been advised of the special needs of our patients. 
However, many commercial carriers are not able to provide the same delivery
services that Baxter’s Service Specialists typically provides to you (such as
the pre-delivery call providing a specific delivery time window or delivering
supplies to a desired location within your home).</span></p>
