</span>This Privacy Policy ("Policy") is designed to tell you about our

information; what kinds of information we collect; why we collect 
information; how we use information we collect; with whom
 we share information we collect; how you can access, amend, and delete 
information we collect from you; and what kinds of security we use to

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The Homecare Services order management and delivery services provide home delivery of dialysis supplies.<span style="">&nbsp;

</span>This information includes, but not limited to, your name, address, phone number and prescription information.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By participating in Baxter&#8217;s Homecare Services program and providing your personal information, you consent to its use by
<span style="">Baxter and third party consultants who are performing work on behalf of Baxter</span>
 for the purposes described in this Policy. In some cases your

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Baxter&#8217;s
 Homecare Services Representatives will work with you and your dialysis 
unit staff to set up your account and initial order and manage
 your ongoing home supply requirements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Baxter&#8217;s Service Specialists will bring your supplies inside your home and rotate your supplies upon your request.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In some cases, an alternate delivery company, such as United Parcel Services (UPS) may deliver your product.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">If
 you or a responsible party are not home during your scheduled delivery,
 Baxter&#8217;s Service Specialist will contact your dialysis facility
 to ask for approval to leave the supplies in a safe place (covered 
porch, garage, etc.), deliver to a neighbor who can sign for the 
shipment, or bring the supplies back to the warehouse, requiring you to 
call Baxter&#8217;s Homecare Services to arrange for a redelivery.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The driver will leave a notice on your door indicating which action was taken.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If redelivery is required, your dialysis unit may incur additional costs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Supply
 orders of 5 cases or less will be delivered by an alternate delivery 
company such as a commercial carrier or United Parcel Services
 (UPS).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Please be aware that the commercial carriers we use have been advised of the special needs of our patients.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, many commercial carriers are not able to provide the 
same delivery services that Baxter&#8217;s Service Specialists typically 
provides to you (such as the pre-delivery call providing a specific 
delivery time window or delivering supplies to a desired
 location within your home).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"><b style=""><u><span style="font-size:12.0pt; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">How we use your Personal Information</span></u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">The
 personally identifiable information we collect from you will only be 
used and disclosed in accordance with this Policy or as specifically
 disclosed to you at the time you provide the information. We will not 
sell, lease, transfer, share, or otherwise permit access to your 
personally identifiable information with any third parties other than as
 described in this Policy. Baxter may share your
 information with independent contractors or consultants who provide 
technical, administrative or market research support to Baxter. We 
reserve the right to sell, lease, transfer, or otherwise share without 
restriction aggregated, deidentified, and other nonpersonally
 identifiable information regarding demographics and other statistics
